# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub!

I'm a software architect with a passion for designing scalable, maintainable, and resilient software systems. My repositories cover core principles of software architecture, design patterns, and coding best practices, with a strong focus on C++. I aim to help developers write clean, efficient, and robust code.
